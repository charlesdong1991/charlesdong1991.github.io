I am Kaiqi Dong, a data scientist based in Amsterdam and I have been working for Catawiki since July 2019. Beforehands, I worked full-time for Royal Schiphol Group for more than 2.5 years and part-time for Randstad for 3 months. I use Python, Spark, pandas, scikit-learn, Hive, Bigquery, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes etc at work. 

In my spare time, I love contributing to open source, and I am the maintainer of pandas, and a contributor to Koalas. Moreover, I published two Python packages: py-roughviz, and StockInsider.

I am a big fan of analytics, visualization and NLP! Get in touch with me for further knowledge sharing!
