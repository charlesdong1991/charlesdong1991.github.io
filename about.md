I am Kaiqi Dong, a data scientist based in Amsterdam and I am now working for Royal Schiphol Group. And I am also working for Randstad part-time as a data scientist. I use Python, Spark, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Hive, AWS, etc in my work. I have hands-on experience in building predictive models, applying different machine learning algorithms and setting up AWS environment.

I am also looking forward to doing freelance assignments. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
